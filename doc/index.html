    	<h2>Bones - skeletal animation for jPCT</h2>
    
    	<p>Bones is a skeletal animation system for <a href="http://www.jpct.net">jPCT</a>. It's aimed to be small library with no additional dependencies 
    	 where possible. Minimum Java version is 1.5. Bones is a partial/modified port of <a href="http://www.ardor3d.com">Ardor3D's</a> animation system to jPCT.</p>
    	 
    	 <p>Bones can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.aptalkarga.com/bones/bones.zip">here</a>. 
    	 Javadocs can be found <a href="api/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It contains
    	 the source code, necessary libraries, Eclipse project files, a demo application and Eclipse launch files to run demos.
    	 It's definitely free software with a <i>"Do whatever with it"</i> license.</p>
    	
    	<p>Bones initially loads skinning information via <a href="http://www.ardor3d.com">Ardor3D's</a> <a href="http://www.collada.org">Collada</a> loader.
    	Out of this information, a series of SkinnedObject3D's are constructed. They have mesh data, textures coordinates and skinning information. 
    	It's enough to set their textures and call build() to prepare them to be added into a jPCT world.      
    	</p>
    	
    	<p>After this initial loading, they can be saved in a compact form. Saved objects can be later reloaded
    	with loader, with no dependencies to Ardor3D</p>
    	
    	<p>At the moment, the project is at <i>"Proof of Concept"</i> phase. Skinning and mesh deformation works but skeleton poses
    	can only be created programmatically. Hence it's not really useful for games at the moment. This is so since, Ardor3D's loader 
    	only support this much at the moment. As they progress, Bones will progress..</p>
    	
    	<p>As Bones is at a very early phase, expect dramatic changes in the API. Even for later phases, the author claims
    	<b>no warranty</b> to maintain backward compatibility.</p>
