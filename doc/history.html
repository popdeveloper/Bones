    	<h2>Bones - Version History</h2>

        <p><font size="-1"><strong>07 February 10: </strong>
        Updated documentation. Added support to clone SkinnedGroup.

        Added support to load Ogre3D animation files (mesh.xml + skeleton.xml)
        via jME's OgreXMl loader. Main motivation behind this was figuring out
        Collada exporters for 3dsMax (both Max's built-in and OpenCollada)
        don't support Pyhsique modifier which is kind of annoying 
        especially considering many of ready to buy models are skinned
        with Pyhsique modifier. In contrast Ogre3D has very nice exporters
        which both support Pyhsique and Skin modifier.

        Ardor3D now supports loading animations and animation blending (SVN pre 0.7 version).
        Updated Bones accordingly without blending. This time
        I've significantly diverged from Ardor's implementation
        for sake of easy usage and to match jPCT semantics.  
        </font></p>
        
		<p><font size="-1"><strong>07 January 10: </strong> 
		First release of Bones. This release is a port of Ardor3D's (0.6) animation system.
		Collada files are loaded via Ardor3D's Collada loader and then
		converted into Bones data structures. Ardor3D doesn't support loading
		animations and so does Bones. Only procedural animation is supported.
