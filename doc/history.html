    	<h2>Bones - Version History</h2>
    	
        <h3>30 March 10: </h3>
        <p class="item">Updated documentation. Fixed a minor bug causing applying skeleton pose twice.
        Added a sample Android application.</p>
    	
        <h3>29 March 10:</h3>
        <p class="item">Added support to load Ogre3D pose animations via jME's OgreXML loader.
	        Renamed many classes to provide some space for new animations.
	        Pose animations can be blended within each other and with a single skin animation.
	        Completely decoupled jME and Ardor3D importing code into new classes. This was necessary to run
	         Bones on Android (Dalvik refuses to load classes if there are constructors/methods
	         which has parameters of unknown classes).
	        Added support to scale/rotate objects/skeleton/animations at import time.
	        Exposed some constructors, methods and data structures to allow programatically 
	        created animated objects, skeletons and animations. Added some more sample applications.</p>

        <h3>07 February 10: </h3>
        <p class="item">Updated documentation. Added support to clone SkinnedGroup.</p>
        
        <h3>06 February 10:</h3>
        <p class="item">Added support to load Ogre3D animation files (mesh.xml + skeleton.xml)
	        via jME's OgreXMl loader. Main motivation behind this was figuring out
	        Collada exporters for 3dsMax (both Max's built-in and OpenCollada)
	        don't support Pyhsique modifier which is kind of annoying 
	        especially considering many of ready to buy models are skinned
	        with Pyhsique modifier. In contrast Ogre3D has very nice exporters
	        which both support Pyhsique and Skin modifier.</p>
        
        <h3>01 February 10:</h3>
        <p class="item">Ardor3D now supports loading animations and animation blending (SVN pre 0.7 version).
	        Updated Bones accordingly without blending. This time
	        I've significantly diverged from Ardor's implementation
	        for sake of easy usage and to match jPCT semantics.</p>  
        
		<h3>07 January 10:</h3>
		<p class="item"> 
		  First release of Bones. This release is a port of Ardor3D's (0.6) animation system.
			Collada files are loaded via Ardor3D's Collada loader and then
			converted into Bones data structures. Ardor3D doesn't support loading
			animations and so does Bones. Only procedural animation is supported.</p>
